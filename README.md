# Toolbox for fast, variational 1D alignment

The code is written in Matlab and C++

## Download

Download the repository via
```
$ git clone https://github.com/phflot/variational_aligner.git
```

## Documentation and Usage

The Code can be compiled and installed with the ```set_path.m``` file. The file ```examples/align_noise.m``` reproduces the alignment of random data from our paper and can be referred to for the usage of the alignment functions.
